     <h3>A bowl of spicy Chicken Yaki Udon</h3>
     <h1>Description</h1>

     <p>This delicious yaki udon stir-fry is similar to yakisoba, but it's made with thick, white udon noodles and tossed with a much simpler sauce. Often used in soups, udon noodles are also delicious fried â€” the texture is just awesome because they are chewy. Try to find frozen or fresh udon noodles. Dried udon noodles will work, but you'll lose some of the signature texture.</p>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 6 ounces frozen udon noodles</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
         <li>1/2 pound boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>1/2 onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
           <li>1/2 cup shredded cabbage</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean chile paste)</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper for taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook udon in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, warm olive oil in large saucepan or wok over medium heat. Add chicken and saute until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion, bell pepper, cabbage, carrots, and garlic. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, allowing vegetables to maintain most of their crispness.</li>
            <li>Pour soy sauce over vegetables and chicken; saute 1 to 2 minutes more. Add udon noodles and toss well. Mix in gojuchang and ketchup, thoroughly combining to mix all the flavors. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>Boneless chicken thighs may be used in place of boneless chicken breasts, if preferred.</p>
        <p>Orange of yellow bell pepper can be substituted for red, if you'd like.</p>
